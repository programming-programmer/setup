#+TITLE: Previous Configuration
#+STARTUP: content

* Alacritty
 * Terminal emulator
 * It's really pretty
 * Might move to st on full linux config
 * Requires cargo (rust package manager to install)
 * No image previews tho :(
 * Make sure SourceCodePro is installed
 * .desktop file
   #+begin_src sh
     [Desktop Entry]
     Name=Alacritty
     GenericName=Terminal Emulator
     Exec=/home/mthich/.cargo/bin/alacritty
     Type=Application
     Terminal=false
   #+end_src
 * Once cargo is installed:
     #+begin_src sh
    cargo install alacritty
     #+end_src
* Bash
 * In order to source bash at .config location, you have to add this to /
   etc/bash.bashrc:

   #+begin_src sh
     if [-s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/bash/bashrc" ]; then
         . "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:=$HOME/.config/}/bash/bashrc"
     fi
   #+end_src

   * Minimal prompt no need for starship

   * aliasrc has all the aliases
   * profile has environment variables (stuff to add to $PATH and default editor)
     * This has to be linked to the .profile in the home directory
   
* cmus
 * Not much to say install via package manager
 * Most likely will switch over to mpd and nmcpppcpp (or whatever it is)

* Emacs
 * Make sure init.el's path to config.org is installed
 * guru-mode doesn't use-package
 * use-package making sure is installed doesn't work either so install before
 * Remember: all-the-fonts-install

 * If there is an error with org, start emacs with "emacs -q" and install org
   9.x. Then reload emacs
   
* lf
 * Download go file
   * Remove any previous Go installation by deleting the /usr/local/go folder (if it exists), then extract the archive you just downloaded into /usr/local, creating a fresh Go tree in /usr/local/go:
      #+begin_src sh
      sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.14.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
      #+end_src

   * Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable.

      #+begin_src sh
      export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
      #+end_src

   * Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:
      #+begin_src sh
       go version
      #+end_src

 * install lf from go
     #+begin_src sh
    env CGO_ENABLED=0 go install -ldflags="-s -w" github.com/gokcehan/lf@latest
     #+end_src

* mpv
 * Install mpv

* nvim
 * Install packer from the website before because it needs it
 * write and source init.lua first then install packers stuff
 * For pyright and clangd (python and c++ respectively) install npm and node
   (I'm not a fulltime c++ coder so no biggie)

* Tmux
 * Install tmux
   #+begin_src sh
tmux source /path/to/tmux/config
   #+end_src
 * Suffer from success

* Zathura
 * Install zathura
 * Not much besides that

* Rust
 * Install via rustup (requires curl)
   
   #+begin_src sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   #+end_src

* Java
 * Download JDK from reputable source
 * untar/unzip in some direcotry (ex. /usr or /opt)
 * Add to path (should already be in /bash/profile)

* Python
 * Install python3 from package manager

* C/C++
 * Install npm for nvim stuff
 * Comes by default
 * I may be forgetting something...
