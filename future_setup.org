* This is an "ideaboard" for future setups

** No need for GRUB theme because I would only run one distro
 * Arch/Artix: I don't care for other flavors since there isn't much of a difference 
 * Debian: If I don't like/am excited about the AUR that much then I can switch over
 * Gentoo: This is the end goal for true minimalism but this is for later

** I don't care about systemd so either one I don't care :shrug:

** Rofi would be important
 * Powermenu: Implement some icons (ctrl+alt or meta P)
 * Shortcut Menu: List all shortcuts and put (if applicable) shortcuts aside (ctrl+alt or meta S)
   * I have a lot of ideas for this one:
     - record screen with ffmpeg
     - take copied yt link and download
     - show clipboard
     - show output of recent program
     - screenshot with scrot
     - start cmus (without tmux running)
     - start lf (without tmux)
     - scratchpad terminal
     - add copied link to newsboat url
     - org-protocol
 * Application Menu: List all applications and put (if applicable) shortcuts
   aside (ctrl+alt or meta A)

** DWM or Sway (wayland)
 * Five workspaces
   * empty
   * browsing
     * nyxt or librewolf with vimium_c
   * terminal
     * you'll have a lot of things in there (rss, music, yadda yadda)
   * Emacs with other stuff
     - In daemon mode, obviously,
   * Terminal with nvim (development)
 * Cycle each one with alt+n or alt+p or alt+#
 * Obviously a terminal scrathpad (alt+s)
   
** Wallpaper _will_ sync up with pywal
 * But gruvbox is simply beutiful
