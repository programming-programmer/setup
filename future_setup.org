* This is an "ideaboard" for future setups

** No need for GRUB theme because I would only run one distro
 * Arch/Artix: I don't care for other flavors since there isn't much of a difference 
 * Debian: If I don't like/am excited about the AUR that much then I can switch over
 * Gentoo: This is the end goal for true minimalism but this is for later (Kenny supremacy)

** I don't care about systemd so either one I don't care :shrug:

** Rofi would be important
 * Powermenu: Implement some icons (ctrl+alt or meta P)
 * Shortcut Menu: List all shortcuts and put (if applicable) shortcuts aside (ctrl+alt or meta S)
   * I have a lot of ideas for this one:
     - record screen with ffmpeg (Luke Smith's video is good)
     - take copied yt link and download (mpv of course)
     - show recent clipboard items
     - show output of recent program
     - screenshot with scrot (or wayland's replacement snag)
     - start cmus (without tmux running)
     - start lf (without tmux)
     - scratchpad terminal
     - add copied link to newsboat url
     - org-protocol 
     - wifi menu
     - calculator
     - emoji picker
 * Application Menu: List all applications and put (if applicable) shortcuts
   aside (ctrl+alt or meta A)

** DWM or Sway (wayland)
 * Five workspaces
   * empty
   * browsing
     * nyxt or brave or librewolf
     * vim bindings is a must (vimium_c)
   * terminal
     * you'll have a lot of things in there (rss, music, yadda yadda)
   * Emacs with other stuff
     - In daemon mode, obviously,
   * Terminal with nvim (development)
 * Cycle each one with alt+n or alt+p or alt+#
 * Obviously a terminal scrathpad (alt+s)
   
** Wallpaper _will_ sync up with pywal
 * But gruvbox is simply beutiful
 * Emacs + pywal
 * LIbrewolf + pywal (pywalfox but should work on librewolf too)

** Stylistic reqs
 * Mild transperacny but add binding to toggle
 * Colored border on focused window
 * I've outgrown rounded corners
 * Snappy feel (so not *too* much bloat just enough lol)
 * coreboot pls?
 * Stickers on laptop (I'll be so proud when you get a monitor)

** What will become of this laptop
 * Will become debian server for media (movies, shows, and music)
 * Maybe a git server along the line
 * Will use all resources towards the VM and enable it to run lid closed (easy fix)
 * No need to masochist install linux. But it would be nice
 * Jellyfin for media
 * Torrent for shows and movies
 * yt-dlp for music

 * I think a 5tb usb drive would be more than enough. I don't have a lot of
   movies and shows I plan to watch and even then I can use fmovies (if that is
   still a viable option down the line)

** Other ideas
 * Minimal keyboards are the way I would like to go
 * A split keyboards seems great but small hhkb keyboards are also cool (like
   the plank ez)
 * I have no desire to switch out the mouse. It is good :)
 * A monitor + docked laptop or laptop end setup sounds nice
 * One libre smartphone for outside stuff/work + flipphone with all important contacts
   * GrapheneOS looks cool
   * fliphone would be simple: talk, text, all music downloaded _(MAIN BAE THO)_
 * A messenger bag to hold all this because I'm still a girlpop gorlie at heart
   would also be nice.
 * I AM PEAK AESTHETIC! NECKBEARDS BEWARE!
 * I have put all I wanted into this. I am finished.
